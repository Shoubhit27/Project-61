Once the king of the city asked Anju and his family members that, "You are the most  intellligent person of this city, I have ever met!Can you catch the theifroaming in the city?"then the ministers of the kingdom said,"Yes, that's a right task for him" then Anju replied,"I will try my best."<br><br>One morning, when Anju went for farming, he saw a manwho was standing behind a huge banyan treeand continuously staring at the wealthiest man in the city, Anju thought that he was the theif. Anju was scared a lot, he tried to relax his mind and he went to the rich man and told him the whole storyin his ear and said  some words aloud,"My banks door is not getting locked so I have just latched it.<br><br>The next day Anju woke up happily as he knew that the theif would go to hisempty little bank, so he went there with some soldiersto his bank and in no time the theif was caught.
